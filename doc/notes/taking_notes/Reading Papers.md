#TakingNotes 

Refer to the Quantum of Knowledge video discussing taking [Bibliography Notes](https://youtu.be/7_6ELlCIl1w?si=6ydT8VW-ql06TWL8&t=782). In this section, the idea of taking [[Fleeting Notes]] is discussed. When reading a paper for the first time, it would be a good idea to upload it to Mendeley, highlight sections and make notes on the highlighted text. After this first reading, these notes can be added to this knowledge base.

When making these notes, in the video, the highlighted source text is kept in the note at the bottom in quotes, and then reframe the idea in your own words above it.
